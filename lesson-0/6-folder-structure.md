## Folder structure

To make navigation and organising your code easier, this course will begin each lesson by asking you to create a folder named after the lesson.

For example, assuming that your development folder is /dev, then the JS code will be organised in such a manner. And within each lesson folder, there will be a lab folder that contains the JS files.

/dev
    /1-writing-javascript
        /lab
    /2-javascript-basic
        /lab
    /...

We will also use the following convention to name the JS script files for ease of reference.

{lesson-no}-{lab-no}-{name-of-the-lab-session}.js
